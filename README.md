# BokkyPooBahs Red-Black Tree Library

Status: **Work in progress. Tidying, testing, documenting before getting audits - don't use yet**

A gas-efficient Solidity data structure to maintain a sorted index for your data.

This library will store `uint`s (equivalent to `uint256`) as the key. Note that the value of 0 is prohibited. Use the sorted keys as indices to your mapping tables of data to access your data in sorted order.

This library uses an iterative (rather than recursive) Red-Black Tree to maintain the sorted keys.

A use-case for this library is to maintain a sorted on-chain decentralise exchange order book.

But wtf is a Red-Black Tree? Following is a representation of Red-Black binary search tree of a randomise list of entries from 1 to 20. The root of the tree is 7, `k` represents the key numbers, `p` the parent, `l` the left node, `r` the right node, and the red-black coloring of each node:

```
            [k1 p2 l0 r0 red]
        [k2 p3 l1 r0 black]
    [k3 p7 l2 r5 black]
            [k4 p5 l0 r0 red]
        [k5 p3 l4 r6 black]
            [k6 p5 l0 r0 red]
[k7 p0 l3 r15 black]
                [k8 p9 l0 r0 red]
            [k9 p11 l8 r10 black]
                [k10 p9 l0 r0 red]
        [k11 p15 l9 r13 red]
                [k12 p13 l0 r0 red]
            [k13 p11 l12 r14 black]
                [k14 p13 l0 r0 red]
    [k15 p7 l11 r18 black]
            [k16 p18 l0 r17 black]
                [k17 p16 l0 r0 red]
        [k18 p15 l16 r20 red]
                [k19 p20 l0 r0 red]
            [k20 p18 l19 r0 black]
```

If you find this library useful for your project, **especially commercial projects**, please donate to [0xb6dAC2C5A0222f6794265249ACE15568B750c2d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6dAC2C5A0222f6794265249ACE15568B750c2d1). I hope to cover my cost of getting this library independently audited.

## History

## Deployment

This library has been designed to be automatically compiled into your Ethereum Solidity contract or library, instead of having to deploy this library and then linking your contract or library to this library.

<br />

<hr />

## Questions And Answers

<br />

<hr />

## Functions

See [contracts/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree.sol](contracts/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree.sol) (or the [flattened](flattened/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree_flattened.sol) version) for an example contract that uses this library.

### insert

```javascript
function insert(Tree storage self, uint z) internal;
```

<br />

### remove

```javascript
function remove(Tree storage self, uint z) internal;
```

## Gas Cost

TODO:

* [ ] Min, Max, Average for 10, 100, 1000, 10000 entries

<br />

<hr />

## Testing

TODO:

* [ ] Test random insertions 10, 1000, 10000
* [ ] Test random insertions and deletions
* [ ] Test repeated random insertions and deletions
* [ ] Test the `view` functions, including what happens when a non-existent key is passed
* [ ] Test deleting a non-existent key
* [ ] Test adding sequentially increasing and decreasing keys
* [ ] Test whether `nodes[0]` is used now (was used when the algorithm was not quite working correctly)
