# BokkyPooBahs Red-Black Tree Library

A gas-efficient Solidity data structure to maintain a sorted index for your data.

This library will store `uint`s (equivalent to `uint256`) as the key. Note that the value of 0 is prohibited. Use the sorted keys as indices to your mapping tables of data to access your data in sorted order.

This library uses an iterative (rather than recursive) Red-Black Tree to maintain the sorted keys.

A use-case for this library is to maintain a sorted on-chain decentralise exchange order book.

If you find this library useful for your project, **especially commercial projects**, please donate to [0xb6dAC2C5A0222f6794265249ACE15568B750c2d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6dAC2C5A0222f6794265249ACE15568B750c2d1). I hope to cover my cost of getting this library independently audited.
